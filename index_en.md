# Research Interests

To understand the human brain functions and develop     treatments for neurological and psychiatric disorders, detailed studies using animal models are essential. However, unlike humans, animals cannot verbally express their internal states — a major challenge, especially when studying brain functions related to emotion and sociality.

I am focusing on the rich repertoire of natural behaviors in animals. These seem to reflect the animals' internal states well. By developing methods to measure and analyze these behaviors, I aim to decipher internal states of animals and uncover the neural mechanisms underlying emotion and social interactions.

Specifically, I have developed AI-based markerless motion capture systems for monkeys and rodents (Video 1) and sound localization systems for analyzing ultrasonic communication in rodents (Video 2). Currently, I am advancing and integrating these technologies to study brain mechanisms underlying social behavior.

# Technology and Environment

Our research primarily uses rats, mice, and non-human primates (macaques and marmosets). In addition to developing  behavior analysis methods, our lab has extensive experience in electrophysiological recording during behavior. We also employ advanced techniques such as optogenetics, chemogenetics, and optical imaging to analyze brain function at the circuit level.

At the University of Toyama, researchers in diverse areas of neuroscience gather at the [Research Center for Idling Brain Science (RCIBS)](http://www.sugitani.u-toyama.ac.jp/rcibs/). 
We also collaborate with domestic (Kagoshima Univ., Kyushu Inst. of Tech., Nagoya City Univ., Kyoto Univ., NCNP, Univ. of Tokyo, etc.) and international partners (Nencki Institute, Univ. of Tübingen, LMU Munich, etc.). Our lab is also part of the [Biology of Behavioral Change (BRAIDYN)](https://braidyn-bc.jp/) research area. Thus, even in a regional setting, our environment offers rich opportunities for collaboration and intellectual exchange with leading researchers.

### Living Environment

Toyama is a region rich in nature, surrounded by the sea and mountains, characterized by its spacious and comfortable living environment. Thanks to the Hokuriku Shinkansen, access to major cities is convenient — about 2.5 hours to Kyoto and 2 hours to Tokyo from Toyama Station.
